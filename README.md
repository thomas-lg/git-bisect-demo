# git-bisect-demo

If you want to demonstrate quickly what git bisect is to your team, feel free to use/modify and do whatever you want with this project.

Feel free to have a look at my [starterkit](https://github.com/thomas-lg/react-webpack-starterkit.git) while you're here :innocent:. I used it for this project.

## Get it

As usual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomas-lg/git-bisect-demo
cd git-bisect-demo
npm i
npm start
```

## Do it

Now that you got the project running, you'll see that the last slide seems to be buggy and that's alright. Your mission is to find the guilty commit :smile:.

To do it we're gonna use `git bisect`. It's a very simple and usefull tool that allow you to spot the commit that introduce a bug in your codebase.

## How to

You must be the guy doing the demo so here is some spoils for you.

See that looking for me? That's the commit that introduce the bug so now question is how to use git bisect to spot it ez and pz.

I do know that the the v1.0 was working perfectly (You can check by yourself ðŸ˜‰). That means that the issue was introduced between the v1.0 commit tag and my current version.

The help command is pretty usefull to understand how it works.

Here we only have to use a few of them.
