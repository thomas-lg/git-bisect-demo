# git-bisect-demo

If you want to demonstrate quickly what git bisect is to your team, feel free to use/modify and do whatever you want with this project.

Feel free to have a look at my [starterkit](https://github.com/thomas-lg/react-webpack-starterkit.git) while you're here :innocent:. I used it for this project.

## Get it

As usual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomas-lg/git-bisect-demo
cd git-bisect-demo
npm i
npm start
```

## Do it

Now that you got the project running, you'll see that the last slide seems to be buggy and that's alright. Your mission is to find the guilty commit :smile:.

To do it we're gonna use `git bisect`. It's a very simple and usefull tool that allow you to spot the commit that introduce a bug in your codebase.
